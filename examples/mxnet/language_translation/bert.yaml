model:                                               # mandatory. used to specify model specific information.
  name: bert 
  framework: mxnet                                   # mandatory. possible values are tensorflow, mxnet, pytorch, pytorch_ipex, onnxrt_integerops and onnxrt_qlinearops.

quantization:
  calibration:                                       # optional. used to specify calibration behavior of post-training-static-quant. other quantization approachs are not necessary.
    sampling_size: 100

evaluation:                                          # optional. used to config evaluation process.
  accuracy:                                          # optional. required if user doesn't provide eval_func in lpot.Quantization.
    iteration: 100

tuning:
  strategy:
    name: basic
  accuracy_criterion:
    relative:  0.01                                  # optional. default value is relative, other value is absolute. this example allows relative accuracy loss: 1%.
  exit_policy:
    timeout: 0                                       # optional. tuning timeout (seconds). default value is 0 which means early stop. combine with max_trials field to decide when to exit.
    max_trials: 9999
  random_seed: 9527                                  # optional. random seed for deterministic tuning.
